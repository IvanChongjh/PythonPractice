# Casting values to int/float.
x = int(5.2) # this will cast then number 5 into integer.
print(x)  # notice from output the decimal place will be removed.
y = float(x)
print(y) # notice the output once cast x to float the decimal place value is removed.


# casting values to string 

z = str("s1")
print(z)

# since x and y are numbers we should be able to perform basic arithmatics 

o = x + y
print(o) # output value is 5 + 5.0 = 10
